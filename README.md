## Lambert W Function

The page introduces the Lambert W function and explains that it is used to solve equations that cannot be handled with ordinary algebraic methods. It describes how certain expressions can be rearranged into a form that allows the Lambert W function to isolate the unknown variable. The text walks through an example that shows how defining an intermediate quantity makes the equation solvable, and it concludes with a short Python example that demonstrates how to compute the numerical solution using common scientific libraries.
